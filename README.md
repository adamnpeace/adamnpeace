### Hi there, I'm Adam! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science Master's Student at University College London, with a focus on Machine Learning. Recently, I implemented a learned approach to reconstruct interior structures from ill-posed CT scan data.

At the moment, I have a particular interest in Reinforcement learning and Machine Vision.
